Design Patterns are general Solutions to Object Oriented Problems. We benefit from the design perspective of other developers.

Design Principles - is the guidelines that help us avoid designing bad Object Oriented design.

Design pattern are often communicated through class diagrams.


Inheritance [IS A] - refer to "object_oriented_design_inheritance.gliffy" OR "object_oriented_design_inheritance.jpg"
------------------

allows to extend the base class through sub-classing

A solid line with an unfilled (open) arrow head indicates inheritance - from child class to parent class. 
Inheritance is indicated as "IS OF" relationship.

An implementing class of an interface will have dotted line from the class to the interface with an unfilled [open] arrow. Dog must implement the Walk method to be of Walkable Type.

A Dog "IS AN" animal and "IS A" Walkable.


Composition/Aggregation [HAS A] - refer to "object_oriented_design_composition.gliffy" OR "object_oriented_design_composition.jpg" 
--------------------------------

Composition OR Aggregation relationship is called "Has A" relationship.
Diamond shaped arrow Head indicates "Has A" relationship. If arrowhead is filled then composition if unfilled then aggregation. Arrowhead points to the target from Source class.
Source is the class that contains the target Object. Ex - Duck is the source Object and Strategy is the target Object.
Composition and Aggregation both imply there is a reference relationship from one object to another.
If referenced Object "Owner" lives even after the referencing Object "Animal" goes away it is aggregation relationship.
If referenced Object "Parts" also goes away along with the referencing object "Body" then it is composition relationship.


Design Principal
----------------

Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.

Program to an interface, not an implementation.

Overview
--------

Classification of Patterns - Pattern_Classification.xml

Creational - related to Objects Instantiation. Provides a way to decouple a client from the way Objects they require are created.


Behavioral - How classes and Objects interact and distribute responsibility.

Structural - Lets you compose classes and Objects into larger structures.



What aren't design patterns
---------------------------
1) Design Patterns are not code lobraries od modules
2) Design Patterns are not coding idioms
3) Design Patterns are not design principles.
Design Principles are more like guidelines for smaller tasks. Design patterns are bigger than principals as they aspire to solve bigger problems.


Strategy Pattern Approach to composing behaviors - design_pattern_duck_example_Efficient.gliffy
------------------------------------------------
After this implementation, it is so easy to switch the behavior classes - refer to MiniDuckSimulatorStrategy -> main().
No duplicate Code, no changes to existing classes

Definition - "Defines a family of Algorithms encapsulating each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients using it."

Designing should always be practical based on the practical use cases that exists at the moment and the scenarios we can think of.
Ex - If there were only 2 types of ducks - Mallard and RedHead then we didn't need the interfaces - FlyBehavior and QuackBehavior.
Strategy pattern is very abstract.

Adapter - Adapter_pattern_pictorial_rep.png
--------
Converting one interface to another. 

Definition - "Convert the interface of a class into another interface client's expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of 
incompatible interfaces."

Category - Structural

Facade - 
------

Definition - "Provides a Unified Interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use."
